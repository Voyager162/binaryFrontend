### Reflection on Trimester 2:

- Over the course of this Trimester 2, I felt like I grew a lot from being in this class. At first I was struggling to keep up with assignments and putting effort but over time I overcame that and worked hard to bring my grade up and learn.


### 5 Things/Accomplishments I did:

#### Frontend and Backend Development- 
- Developed a frontend page and an api/model in the backend storing binary/decimal conversions in the backend data table. 
- They would both be connected through crud methods and python URI (connecting to the api). 
- We use data in the backend for Binary Trials and Converter (my features) 

#### Binary Trials 
- This is a game where two player compete towards reaching the end. They take turns answer questions where they have to convert decimal to binary. 
-If they get it right they get to go forward, but if they get it wrong they stay in place 
- Uses a ready up feature where the two players have to ready up to enter the game
- Helps the user learn and solidfy there understanding on binary

#### Binary Converter

- This is my second feature, which allows the user to test and check binary conversions
- Can act like as a tool since users can test if they got the answer correct
- Helps Solidify the users understanding
